Java GUI personal project where I have developed code that displays chord diagrams and allows
the user to click the volume icon to hear what the chord sounds like.

Helpful for beginners seeking to learn chords from the ease of a single interface

My goal is to continue adding and making Minor chord diagrams, 7 chord diagrams, diminished chords, and allow tabs for the user to swap between the different kinds of chords.
